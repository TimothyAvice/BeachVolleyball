<img src="images/volleyball.jpg" alt="Volleyball">
<p>Volleyball is a sport played in two teams on a court divided in the middle by a net. The sport originated in the United States, and is only now gaining the type of popularity in the U.S. that it is receiving on a global basis, where it ranks just as it ranks in the top two most participated sports, just behind soccer. There are currently 800 million players worldwide that participate in a volleyball match at least once a week. In a game of Volleyball, the main goal of the game is for each team to hit the ball over the net regularly to ground it on the opponent’s court, while preventing the ball contacting its own ground. The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net towards the opposing teams court.

Each side can hit the ball three times (In addition to block contact) to pass it over the net to the opposing side, with each player is not allowed to hit the ball two consecutive times, apart from blocks. This rally continues until the ball contacts the floor/ ground, goes “out” or a team fails to return it to the other court or commits a fault.

</div><br> The winning team in a rally scores a point (Rally point system), and gains the right to serve, with the players required to rotate one position clockwise. A match is one when a team scores the most out of three or five games. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (No scoring cap). If a deciding game does take place, the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (No scoring cap) wins.</p>
