<p>Currently it is recorded that there are 800 million players worldwide that participate in a volleyball match at least once a week. Volleyball is a sport anyone can play; it is safe, fun and isn’t that bad on the body. It requires little movement around the court, meaning it’s great for people who want to participate in a low-impact sport to help them get in shape without pushing their bodies to far.

For the people who are more on the competitive side, volleyball games can become quite exciting and tense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents. Beach volleyball is great for people of all ages, men and women alike. For anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program, you should first speak to your doctor to find what’s suitable for your body.</p>
