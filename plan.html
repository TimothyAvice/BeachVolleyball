   <h1> Project Plan - BeachVolleyball: Slammers <br><br>Club plan</h1>
  <p class="bold">Timothy Avice Du Buisson <br>jc439081 </p>
<h2 class="underline">Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Slammers goal is to attract a younger audience towards the slammers club as well as increase the overall customer base attending slammers each week. The website aims to produce at least a 50% increase to the number of customers, currently 100, playing at slammers each week.<br>
  </p>
  <h2 class="underline">Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> The goal will be measured by assessing the amount of customer’s slammers gets after the website launches. The new amount will then be compared to the old amount of 100 to asses if any changes occurred and whether the 50% increase goal was reached.</p>
<h2 class="underline">Target Audience</h2>
<p>Teenagers and young adults, people between the age of 15-30, who are physically active and enjoy participating in sports. Therefore, the site will need to adapt a simplistic design with a consistent colour scheme used throughout. The information presented should also be easy to read, and the theme of the site will need to be volleyball, with elements from volleyball presented throughout.</p>
